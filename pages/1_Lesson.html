<li>Back in the early 1980s, the BBC launched a computer literacy project, working with a company called Acorn to produce a computer called the BBC Micro.

<li>The machines were highly popular with schools, and were many people's first experience with computers. They could be programmed using a language called BASIC, and had different games and programs that could be run on them. You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro">here</a>.
</li>
<li>Fast-forward 30 years or so, and the BBC have kindly produced the BBC Micro:bit - a computer you can carry, being given to every year 7 in the country to keep (you can take yours home once you've completed this topic).

<li>Let's write our very first program for the Micro:bit right now.
</li>
<li>Open the Micro:bit site, by opening <a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk/create-code">this link</a> in a new tab.
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk/create-code">https://www.microbit.co.uk/create-code</a>
</li>
<li>Scroll down slightly, and click the link under the "Python" heading that says, "New project".
</li>
<li>Your screen should look something like this:
</li>
</ul>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/python_ide.png" alt="python_ide.png" />
</p>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Change the line 7 (they're numbered along the left-hand edge) to greet you by name rather than writing "Hello World".
</li>
<li>We can now put this program to our Micro:bit and see it work in the real World. Follow these instructions carefully:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Gently plug the small end of the USB cable you've been given by your teacher into the socket on the Micro:bit. <b>NOTE:</b> The cable must go in the right way up; it does not need to be forced, otherwise it'll break.
</li>
<li>Plug the larger end of the USB cable into your PC. Again, this will only fit one way round. 
</li>
<li>The Micro:bit will boot up, and a short demo sequence will start.
</li>
<li>Click the <b>Download</b> button in the top-left hand corner of the browser window. After a few moments, you'll see a dialogue box appear. Click <b>Save File</b> and it will disappear. 
</li>
<li>Open <b>My Computer</b> or a file explorer window, and navigate to your Downloads folder&#x2026;
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/download2.png" alt="download2.png" />
</p>
</div>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You'll see an enthusiastically named file with <b>.hex</b> written at the end of it in this folder (E.g. <i>awesome program.hex</i>). This is your program, ready to go onto the Micro:bit. Right-click on this file and choose 'cut'.
</li>
<li>Look down the different drive-letters in your explorer window, and find the one labelled <b>MICROBIT</b>. Click on this to open it.
</li>
</ol>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/download3.png" alt="download3.png" />
</p>
</div>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You'll see 3 files in here, with names like AUTORST.CFG and DETAILS.TXT which will let you know you're in the right place. Right-click in this folder, and choose <b>Paste</b> to place your program onto the Microbit. the yellow LED on the back of the unit will flicker while your program transfers, and after a few seconds, your program will run. You can repeat this process whenever you want to put a new program on the Micro:bit.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let's think about what the program you've got running is actually doing for a second. Here is is again:
</li>
</ul>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"># Add your Python code here. E.g.
from microbit import *

while True:
    display.scroll('Hello, World!')
    display.show(Image.HEART)
    sleep(2000)
</pre>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first line starts with a <b>#</b> symbol. This tells MicroPython that this line is a <i>comment</i> written for humans to read. Any line you put a # at the start of will be ignored by the Micro:bit. 
</li>
<li>The <code>from microbit...</code> line is fetching some special code to allow our programs to control the buttons and LEDs on the Micro:bit. You'll always need this line at the start of the programs you write. 
</li>
<li>The <code>while True</code> line starts something called a loop, which you'll have encountered before in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">scratch</a>. We won't focus too much on this in our first lesson, but these are important in programming and we'll re-visit them later on. For now, its enough to know that any lines of code that come after it AND are indented (see how the next instructions are a few spaces away from the left margin?) will be repeated over and over forever.
</li>
<li>The <code>display.scroll()</code> line asks the Micro:bit to display whatever text is written in quotes inside the brackets on the LED display.
</li>
<li><code>display.show()</code> makes images appear on the display. A heart is built into Micro:Python, as are rather a lot of <a href="http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/images.html">others</a> too.
</li>
<li><code>sleep()</code> tells the Micro:bit to wait a number of milliseconds (there are 1000 in 1 second) before carrying out the next instruction.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-1-4">Save It</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To save your code (so you can come back to it another day), you need to download it to your computer.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Click "My Scripts" in the top-left corner of the coding window.
</li>
<li>Click the "Save" button on the right-hand side of the new page.
</li>
<li>Click "Save File" on the download window that appears.
</li>
<li>Locate the <b>.jsz</b> file that has been saved to your Downloads folder, and cut/paste it into your H: drive.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To open a previously saved file in future, you can drag and drop .jsz files from your <b>My Computer</b> window onto the <b>My Scripts</b> page on the Micro:bit site.
</li>

<li>This video walks you through the process.
